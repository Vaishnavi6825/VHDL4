A Half Subtractor is a combinational logic circuit designed to perform the subtraction of two single-bit binary numbers. It has two inputs and two outputs: the difference and the borrow. Outputs:  Difference (Diff): Represents the result of A - B. Borrow: Indicates whether a 1 has been borrowed from a higher bit in case A is smaller than B.
